   <p class="paragraph">Connect-Four-Emojis is a two-player game<br>in which players alternately place Emojis on a vertical board 7 columns across
        and 6 rows high.<br> Each player uses Emojis of a particular face (commonly lovely and laugh),<br> and the object is to be the first to obtain four Emojis in a horizontal,
            vertical, 
            or diagonal line.<br> Because the board is vertical, Emojis inserted in a given
             column always drop to the lowest unoccupied row of that column.<br>As soon as a column contains 6 Emojis, it is full and no other Emoji can be placed in the column.

             <br>Both players begin with 21 identical Emojis, <br>
    and the first player to achieve a line of four connected Emojis wins the game.<br>
     If all 42 move are played and no player has places four Emojis in a row,
      the game is drawn.</p>
